# Holy Responsive Grid, Batman!

Now we'll be using Grid to change a holy grail layout into a responsive layout. Use whatever tools you like, as long as those tools include media queries!


### Setup

This is a fork-and-clone situation. Go do that thing!


### Basics

You have as resources:

1. A holy grail layout. Your desktop layout is done!
2. Screenshots in `assets` for a tablet layout and a mobile layout.


### Your Goal

It doesn't have to be _pixel-perfect_, but implement the following two layouts:

1. A mobile layout that takes effect if the screen is below 800 pixes wide.
2. A tablet layout that takes effect if the screen is bigger than the mobile layout but at or below 1100 pixels wide.

The goal here is to practice your media queries and Grid. So don't worry about exact dimensions! If something looks like it's ABOUT 20% of the height, that's good enough.


### Some Grid Tools You Might Use

* Grid Areas
* Using `span [n]` to span rows and columns instead of having to say what line they end with.
